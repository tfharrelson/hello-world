# hello-world
place to store ideas and discuss them with others

I am a PhD student at UC Davis in chemical engineering that works on computational chemistry/materials science projects (ironic I know) related organic electronics. Thus far, my work has primarily focused on applying some combination of density functional theory and molecular dynamics codes to understand the structure and function of a variety of organic electronic materials. This is my first time using github, and it seems like a great way to connect people for scientific research (and definitely more). Outside of research, I am a big proponent of science communication, which is a public outreach idea that scientists need to educate the public. This requires explaining complicated concepts (such as my research) in simple language that a person with a non-scientific background can understand. Hopefully my github account can help shed some light on the mysteries of science to people who are curious. So, if you have any questions about any of the content here, feel free to ask.
